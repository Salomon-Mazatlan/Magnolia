/**
 * pending-selection-store — the user's currently-pending text selection
 * in the active document viewer, lifted out of the viewer components so
 * other surfaces (notably the New Code dialog) can read it.
 *
 * Why this exists: each document viewer (plain-text, PDF, image, video)
 * tracks its own `pendingSelection` in local React state so it can
 * render the right-click context menu and apply codes via hotkey. The
 * Code Browser's "+ Code" button lives in a sibling pane, though, and
 * the New Code modal is rendered in App.tsx — neither has direct access
 * to a viewer's local state. Each viewer mirrors its local
 * pendingSelection into this store so App.tsx can read it the moment
 * the user finishes creating a code.
 *
 * Not persisted. Cleared whenever the active doc tab changes.
